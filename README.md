# barcode-generator
An EAN13 barcode generator written in python.

Requires pillow: pip install pillow

This is an EAN13 barcode generator written in python. It saves barcodes as a png image with their corresponding number below them. It also saves the number in a text file list to ensure there are no duplicate barcodes generated.

How it works:

- Type the title of your item into the prompt and click the submit button
- Barcode will be generated

How to find your items:

This is a simple program, so the best way to find your programs is to simply search the barcode number or item title using CTRL+F in the text file titled "item_title.txt".
Updates will be coming in a different repository with a better search and scan feature.
